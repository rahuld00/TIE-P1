      <p class="intro">India's surge in infections began around mid-March and increased rapidly, reaching a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on Friday, 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday, 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday. And on Thursday, 6 May, the number of new recorded daily infections reached a new high of more than 414,000. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p class="intro">India has recorded 26 million Covid-19 cases - second only to the US. It is the new epicentre of the global pandemic. The second wave in recent weeks has overwhelmed the healthcare system, leaving hospitals struggling to cope and critical drugs and oxygen in short supply.   </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
